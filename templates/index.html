			<h1>Hi, weâ€™re Paws.</h1>
			<h2>We rescue, shelter and adopt out cats and dogs in NYC.</h2>

			<p>We are extremely proud of the number pet adoptions we have facilitated, and the number of animals we have rescued over the years; successfully placing them with loving families.  Many of these cats and dogs came from dire circumstances and have been given another chance to share their lives with new families..</p>

			<p>Email us now for a list of all adoptable pets: <a mailto:"adoptme@paws.com">adoptme@paws.com</a></p>
